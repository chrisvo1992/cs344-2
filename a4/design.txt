create a buffer_1 for the characters read
create a buffer_2 for the conversion of line sep to space 
create a buffer_3 for the conversion of ++ to ^ 

threads:
	1. read_input_t, reads from stdin, replacing all line separators by a space.
	2. space_replace_t, replaces all line separators by a space.
	3. plus_plus_t, replaces every pair of ++ with ^.
	4. output_t, write line(s) of 80 characters plus the remaining < 80
		when a termination symbol is encountered, followed by a line
		separator.

definitions:
	line separator = '\n'
	termination symbol = STOP, with spaces at beg and end, all upper case
	allowed chars = ascii values [32,126]
	80 char line = 80 chars + line separator

requirements:
	- no character processing takes place after termination symbol.
	- input will not contain any empty lines.
	- an input line will not be longer than 1000 characters, including the 
		line separator.
	- the input for the program will never have more than 49 lines before
		the termination symbol
	- program does not need to do any input checking
	- program will not wait until reaching term symbol to print output.
		when 80 chars have been read, print them.
