To run the program:

	make 

To recompile:

	make clean && make

To run with arguments:

	./main < infile > outfile
	
		or
	
	./main > outfile < infile

		or

	./main < infile

		or

	./main > outfile


Currently, one of the threads doesnt end...
So, if the program doesn't output anything
to either stdout or the file, try running
the same command again a few more times.

I have tested this multiple times, doing so
will give results. I've included a video
file demonstrating it.

I am currently working on figuring out why
this is happening but its 10:56p on Feb 22.
