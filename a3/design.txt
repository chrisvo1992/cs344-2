2. check that the given command line input is not greater
	than 2048 characters and 512 arguments

	- if not, go to step 5

5. check for redirection
	- set the proper stdin and stdout paths

6. check if the command should be run in the background
	- if not, create the process
	- if yes, set background to true and create process
